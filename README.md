# Spectral_Analysis_Package
Tools for spectral analysis in 1D and 2D. Includes rotary spectral capabilities.

Versions compatible with GNU/Octave (slight chages from default MATLAB versions) should be available in the future. Feel free to branch your own GNU/Octave version if I do not get around to this in a timely manner.

Corrections and translations to other commonly used scientific programming languages are welcome and encouraged.
